    This is a simple website, created for my brother, who started his adventure as a personal trainer. I wanted to create a project that would benefit both of us. So I came up with the idea of creating a website that will be his personal business card, and I will put it in my portfolio 😄

## 📝 About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://darekpietrzak.online/)

The site is entirely made by me. Like any project, I started my work by drawing a initial template. I must admit that later it became quite chaotic because I did not design this page precisely, for example in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> as I do now 😅
During the code writing, many times I improved the final appearance of the website until finally I was satisfied with the final result.

Thanks to this project I learned how to make great animations thanks to <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/">gsap</a>, and I got to know <a href="https://lenis.studiofreight.com/">Lenis</a> smooth scroll. During the development process, the biggest problem was writing responsive code. I finally managed to overcome this difficulty and I am very happy that I have taken up the fight against this problem because I have learned a great lesson for the future 💪
